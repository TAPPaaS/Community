# TAPPaaS Module: immich — photostorage service install
#
# Ensures the photo storage declared in immich.json ("mediaStorage") is
# present and mounted at /var/lib/immich (Immich's mediaLocation). Modes:
#
#   allocate — the module owns the disk: if slot scsi2 is empty, allocate a
#              fresh volume (mediaDiskStorage/mediaDiskSize) and format it.
#              Declaring this mode in the config is the consent; the only
#              thing ever formatted is the blank volume created seconds
#              earlier. An existing disk at scsi2 is never touched.
#   attached — the operator provides the disk (USB/iSCSI): verify only.
#              Never allocates or formats. Prepare the disk interactively
#              with setup-media-disk.sh (relabel/format with confirmation).
#   share    — /var/lib/immich is a network share mounted via immich.nix:
#              no disk, verify the mount only.
#
# Idempotent and safe to re-run in every mode.
#
# Called automatically by install-module.sh because immich provides "photostorage".
# Run directly for recovery:
#   ./services/photostorage/install-service.sh
